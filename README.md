# Modena in JavaFX 19 (OpenJFX)
## Maven dir
`%HOMEPATH%` on Windows is: `C:\Users\USERNAME`

Extraction of the modena directory extracted from JavaFX 19 (from Maven) on Windows - path: `%HOMEPATH%\.m2\repository\org\openjfx\javafx-controls\19\javafx-controls-19-win.jar`

## Modena dir
The modena folder is extracted from the jar file and can be found inside: `javafx-controls-19-win.jar` under (once extracted): `\com\sun\javafx\scene\control\skin`
A lot of developers want to know the CSS so that they can easily override specific parts of the CSS in their applications.
Since JavaFX (OpenJFX) is open source, I extracted the entire folder containing the core CSS files and images from the jar file and put it here.
I hope this will help you understand the CSS structure and override it more easily.

Beware that this is extracted from Windows and there may be platform specific CSS rules/hacks in it.

## Only interested in the core CSS file?
